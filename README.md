# Stick-Fighter-Tournament

## Prompts

Make a stick figure, 2D fighting game for the web using any web tech needed like HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React, Next.js, etc. It needs to be modular and modifiable, with settings, a menu, and use JSON for static character editing. Each character should have light, heavy, and special attacks for neutral, forward, up, down, backward, and command inputs for them. Use animation frameworks and include projectiles.

Yes, then make a structure .txt showing ALL the files AND show me what should be in each file.

Yes, and do something similar that allows me to make sprites for projectiles, and animations for attacks.

yes, then show me all the files, completed, because it's hard for me to know where in the files I should put the scripts you give me.

Nice! I want you to watch these YouTube videos so you get an idea of what I want the stickman combat, fighting system, combos, moves, etc. to look like:

Alan Becker's Animation Vs., there are too many to list but you get the idea. 

When you finish, I would like the game updated a good bit so it's capable of a similar combat feel.

Add a menu, a training dummy, which will act as player 2 in "Training Mode", which can take knock back and hitstun just like a player

Add settings to the menu, allowing players control over keybinds and volume
