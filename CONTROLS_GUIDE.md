1. Execute a directional motion (e.g., Down → Down-Right → Right)
2. Within 1 second of completing the motion, press the attack button
3. If the game recognizes the pattern, the special move will execute

## Understanding the Super Meter

### Meter Management

**Gaining Meter**
- Land a hit: +10 to +25 points (varies by move)
- Take damage: +50% of damage taken

**Example**: 
- Alpha's Light Punch hits for 40 damage and grants 10 meter
- Beta takes 40 damage and gains 20 meter (50% of 40)

**Spending Meter**
- Each super move costs 100 points (1 level)
- With 300 max meter, you can store up to 3 super levels
- Visual indicator shows current level (0-3)

### Super Meter Levels

- **0 Meter**: Empty (yellow bar is empty)
- **1 Level (100 meter)**: 1/3 meter filled - can use 1 super
- **2 Levels (200 meter)**: 2/3 meter filled - can use up to 2 supers
- **3 Levels (300 meter)**: Full meter - can use up to 3 supers

## Combo System

### Building Combos

A combo is a sequence of consecutive hits without the opponent escaping hitstun.

**Hitstun**: The duration an opponent is stunned after being hit. While stunned, they cannot act.

**Combo Scaling**: Each hit in a combo deals slightly less damage
- Hit 1: 100% damage
- Hit 2: 95% damage  
- Hit 3: 90% damage
- And so on... (minimum 10% damage)

### Resetting Combos

The combo counter resets when:
- The opponent recovers from hitstun (stun timer expires)
- You get hit by the opponent

### Ending Combos

The combo display shows:
- **Combo: 0** = No active combo
- **Combo: 5** = 5 consecutive hits landed
- **Combo: 15** = Extended combo (good damage scaling)

### Alpha's Special: Healing Combo

Starting at 5+ consecutive hits, Alpha gains **2 HP per hit**. This stacks with damage scaling!

**Example**:
- Hit 1-4: Deal normal damage, no healing
- Hit 5+: Each hit heals Alpha while dealing damage

This means Alpha can potentially heal back health during long combos!

## Advanced Techniques

### Combo Strings

Try linking multiple hits together:
1. Light Punch (J)
2. Light Kick (D + J)
3. Heavy Uppercut (K) - for launcher
4. Jump into Heavy Slam (W + K)

### Command Input Combos

Finish your combo with a command input special:
1. Land 3-4 hits to build meter
2. Execute a command input special before hitstun ends
3. Continue combo flow into super move

### Managing Resources

- **Early Game**: Build meter with safe hits
- **Mid Game**: Use command inputs when meter reaches 100+
- **Late Game**: Save meter for finishing supers or come-back moments

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Executing commands too slowly**: Commands must be done within 1 second
2. **Wrong direction sequence**: Make sure you do the exact motion (check input display at bottom)
3. **Forgetting super cost**: Command supers require 100 meter - check your level!
4. **Attacking while stunned**: Can't input attacks while flashing white
5. **Getting predictable**: Opponents can see your patterns - mix up your combos!

## Tips & Tricks

- **Footsies**: Use jabs and low attacks to control space
- **Launcher Combos**: Use Heavy Neutral to launch and follow up in air
- **Meter Building**: Heavy attacks and specials grant more meter
- **Tempo Control**: Slower recovery moves give opponent time to recover - use faster moves for combos
- **Spacing**: Keep distance to whiff combos and avoid punishment
